# Gyroflow - Video stabilization using gyroscope data targeting drone footage (WIP)

A program built around Python, OpenCV, and PySide2 for video stabilization using gyroscope data.

The project consists of three core parts: A utility for the generation of lens undistortion preset, a utility for stabilizing footage using gyro data, and a utility for stretching 4:3 video to 16:9 using non-linear horizontal stretching (similar to GoPro's superview).

This is currently a work in progress project, but the goal is to use the gyro data logged by drone flight controllers for stabilizing the onboard HD camera. Furthermore, the gyro data embedded in newer GoPro and insta360 cameras should also be usable for stabilization purposes.

The launcher containing all the utilities is available by executing `gyroflow.py` if all the dependencies are met. Otherwise a binary can be found over in [releases](https://github.com/ElvinC/gyroflow/releases). The current release is very outdated and another alpha executable will be available in the near future after a bit more work on blackbox support. Also, check out the wiki where there's some more information about the camera calibration and video stabilization process.

**Working:**
* Videoplayer based on OpenCV and Pyside2
* Gyro integration using quaternions
* Non-linear stretch utility
* Basic video import/export
* Camera calibration utility with preset import/export
* GoPro metadata import
* Symmetrical slerp-based quaternion low-pass filter
* Blackbox data import
* Undistort and rotation perspective transform
* Semi-automatic temporal gyro/video sync. Not super robust but works most of the time.


**Work in progress:**

* Stabilization UI. Working barebone version without video player added. Feel free to try it out using Hero 6 or Hero 8 files or files modified with BlackboxToGPMF, but this is still work in progress.
* Gyro orientation presets
* blackbox orientation handling. Testing ways of avoiding the need for manual sync in blackbox explorer using more robust sync algorithm.

**Not working (yet) and _potential_ future additions and ideas:**
* Improved low-pass filter and more stabilization modes (Time-lapse, separate pitch/yaw/roll smoothness control etc.)
* Incorporate acceleration data in orientation estimation for horizon lock (Probably just a complementary filter. Kalman is overkill but could be fun to learn).
* Automatic camera alignment identification with respect to gyro
* Streamlining/optimizing the image processing pipeline
* Rolling shutter correction (and determination?)
* Automatic determination of required crop
* Integration with external logger hardware
* Native support for other cameras with internal gyro if there's interest (insta360, sony A7 series?)
* Support for reading and writing professional video formats
